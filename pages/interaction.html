        <h1> Universal Interaction </h1>
        <p>
            Fides is designed from the ground up to be a universal interaction language.

        <h2> Relation with process calculi </h2>
        <p>
        Although Fides is not a calculus, it shares some key features with process calculi:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Execution corresponds to code modification, according to the semantics.
                This implies that any runtime state can be represented by code in a straightforward manner.
                It also implies that code is ephemeral by default; it disappears after being executed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Concurrency is achieved simply via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus#Parallel_composition"> parallel composition</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Communication happens via channels and message passing.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Principled unbounded metaprogramming
        </h2>
        <p>
        Unbounded metaprogramming allows processes to write arbitrary Fides code programmatically at runtime, while ensuring that no illegal code can be written. The latter is achieved via a faithful representation of Fides within Fides as typeful values.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>
            Universal trusted third party
        </h2>
        <p>
        A designated channel allows communication with the Launcher, which provides certified code launch as a service. Given a piece of Fides code that defines a process behavior, the Launcher starts a process with the given behavior, and returns a signed launch certificate for the given code.
        </p>
        <p> This makes the Launcher a universal trusted third party, as well as a personification of Fides.</p>

        <p> This  <a href="https://github.com/Bersier/fides">Github project</a>
            is a work-in-progress implementation of Fides in Scala. </p>
